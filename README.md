# My Solutions to Problems on LeetCode
This repository contains my personal solutions to problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). Each problem is organized in a separate folder (also added simple comments to explain this or that action, see the code if you are interested), and the solutions are implemented using [C++](#prerequisites "C++"), [CMake](#prerequisites "CMake") and [Clang](#prerequisites "Clang") (for testing purposes). The solutions are not necessarily the most optimal ones, but they are the ones that I came up with. My profile on LeetCode can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/Aleksandr-Strashevskiy/).
